    "Transfer learning is becoming an interesting topic in deep learning which makes learning with little data feasible. For example, a pretrained large scale neural network or a neural network trained on a large-scale dataset can be applied to solve a different but related problem. Another example is fine tuning a pretrained neural network (ex. ImageNet) to solve a problem with little data. Recently, transfer learning has been used for image segmentation like TernausNet (TernausNet: U-Net with VGG11 Encoder Pre-Trained on ImageNet for Image Segmentation, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.05746.pdf). In TernausNet, the network used a VGG11 network pretrained on ImageNet to serve as the encoder of a U-Net and trained the rest on the Carvana dataset for an image segmentation task.\n",
